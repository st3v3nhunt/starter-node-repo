## Usage

Create a new repository from this template and run `./rename.js` specifying the
new name of the repository and the description to use e.g.

```shell
./rename.js my-new-repo "Really useful description"
```

Once the rename has been completed the script can be removed.

If there is an issue during the rename the changes can be reverted via
`git clean -df && git checkout -- .`

## Running the application

The application is Dockerised and can be run via `docker` or `docker compose`
commands. The easiest option is to use the `docker-compose` files and run the
application via `docker-compose up --build`. Alternatively, the same can be
achieved by building the image and running it with docker:

```shell
docker build . --build-arg NODE_ENV=development -t starter-node-repo

docker run --init -p 3000:3000 -p 9229:9229 -t starter-node-repo
```
